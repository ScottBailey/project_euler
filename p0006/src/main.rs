/*

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
   1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
   (1+2+...+10)^2=552=3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
